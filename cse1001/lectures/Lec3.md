### Bianary:

- $2^n$ possible combinations where 2 is the number of  bianary digits
  
  - EX: 1101 is 4 digits is $2^4$ possible combinations 



### Main Memory Organization

- the smallest ammount of memory that is accessable is  called byte addressable 

- Main memory alse called Random Access Memory also called RAM.

- The number of bytes per data item can vary between computers.
  
  - A 32-bit compuer will use 4 byte integer while a 64- bit computer can use either 4 or 8 byte integer

## Computer Programming

- Input
  
  - from a file of the user

- Processes
  
  - changes stuff

- output
  
  - returns data

### different types of programms

- System software
  
  - Uset by the computer to run itself and other software

- User Applications
  
  - Not required for the system to operate and built on top of the system

##### Software interfaces

1. GUI: Windows, menues, buttons
   
   Also called **Event Driven** interfaces

2. Command lines: Terminal, dos, powershell, bash

3. API: Allows one program to communicate with another program or with a different device EX: weather / location programs

#### Different tyrpes of programming languages

- high-level programming languages

- Machine languages

- Assembly languages

- Literal circuits

- Fucking math
  
  ##### High-level programming languages
  
  - This is they type of programming languages that humans use
  
  - Also called source code
  
  ##### Machine Languages
  
  - Very difficualt for humans to read (just 1 or 0)
  
  - Hardware dependant and can only run on the devive it was compiled for
  
  - A compiler changes a high level  programmming language into machine code
  
  ### Terms
  
  1. Compile: to process cource code into object iles (machine code)
  
  2. Link: links stuff together <stdio.h>, fuctions and other stuff
  
  3. Builds: create execuatable file and includes bothe rcompiling and linking
  
  4. Compiler: the program that does the compiling
  
  5. Linker: creates the execuatble file.
